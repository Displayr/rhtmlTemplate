<h2>The Internal WWW Server</h2>

  <span class="note">Delete this description in your new widget repo</span><br/>

  <p>
    This internal WWW server hosts content that allows you to see your work while making updates to the html widget.
    The content listed in the index is automatically gathered from two sources:
    <ul>
      <li>Any directory in <span class="code">theSrc/internal_www/content</span> that contains at least one html file will be listed on the index page as a list of links, with the directory name as the title of the list</li>
      <li>Each group defined in the test plans found in <span class="code">theSrc/test/snapshotTestDefinitions</span> will be listed.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <p>
    In the rhtmlTemplate repo I have structured the content directory into `examples` and `tutorials`, and there is also an `experiments` dir just to demonstrate you can put anything you want in content which helps for rapid experimentation.

    Here are the intended purposes of each section, keeping in mind they all do the same thing:
    <ul>
      <li><span class="emphasis">Tutorial</span>: Build one or more tutorial pages to describe how your app works. The content should be descriptive and should serve to demonstrate key features to users and future maintainers.</li>
      <li><span class="emphasis">Examples</span>: Key reference examples of use here.</li>
      <li><span class="emphasis">Scratch</span>: This is just a scratch space to capture any ongoing dev work.</li>
    </ul>

    Note that since the introduction of the yaml based test plans, I no longer recommend extensive use of html files to present the widget configurations. The yaml syntax is a lot easier to maintain and organise for larger projects.

  <h3>The experiments section can be found <a href="/experiments/ui">here</a>. Writeup pending.</h3>
